# Proposal to Implementation Mapping

## 1. Purpose

This document explains how the proposal materials under [`proposal/`](proposal/) are translated into implementation modules, outputs, and paper sections.

It ensures that the project remains anchored to the approved proposal rather than drifting into an unrelated technical build.

---

## 2. Proposal Source Files

Primary source materials:
- [`proposal/Proposal_form.docx`](proposal/Proposal_form.docx)
- [`proposal/Proposal_form.md`](proposal/Proposal_form.md)

These files define the business problem, target stakeholders, methodology direction, analytical tools, and dataset selection.

---

## 3. Problem Statement Mapping

### Proposal statement
The proposal defines churn as a business problem affecting recurring revenue and retention efficiency in subscription-based service providers.

### Implementation mapping
This is implemented through:
- churn prediction modeling,
- churn driver interpretation,
- retention prioritization outputs.

Related modules:
- [`src/train.py`](src/train.py)
- [`src/evaluate.py`](src/evaluate.py)
- [`src/prioritize.py`](src/prioritize.py)

---

## 4. Solution Buyer Mapping

### Proposal statement
The proposal identifies retention managers, CRM managers, and marketing decision-makers as solution users.

### Implementation mapping
This implies that outputs must be manager-readable, not just technically correct.

Therefore the project must produce:
- comparison tables,
- interpretable feature insights,
- ranked customer priority lists,
- business-friendly charts.

Related outputs:
- [`outputs/tables/model_performance_comparison.csv`](outputs/tables/model_performance_comparison.csv)
- [`outputs/tables/customer_priority_table.csv`](outputs/tables/customer_priority_table.csv)
- [`outputs/figures/`](outputs/figures/)

---

## 5. Methodology Mapping

### Proposal methodology elements
The proposal specifies:
- business understanding,
- exploratory data analysis,
- data cleaning,
- multiple classification models,
- model comparison,
- interpretation of important variables,
- retention prioritization support.

### Implementation mapping
These map directly to the planned pipeline:

1. Cleaning  
   [`src/preprocess.py`](src/preprocess.py)
2. EDA  
   [`src/eda.py`](src/eda.py)
3. Modeling  
   [`src/train.py`](src/train.py)
4. Evaluation  
   [`src/evaluate.py`](src/evaluate.py)
5. Explainability  
   [`src/explain.py`](src/explain.py)
6. Retention Prioritization  
   [`src/prioritize.py`](src/prioritize.py)
7. Full orchestration  
   [`src/run_pipeline.py`](src/run_pipeline.py)

---

## 6. Analytical Tool Mapping

### Proposal analytical tools
The proposal identifies Python and Tableau.

### Implementation interpretation
Current implementation focuses on Python as the primary analytics engine.

Tableau remains optional for:
- final dashboard styling,
- stakeholder presentation,
- additional visual storytelling.

In practice, the project should first ensure that Python outputs are complete under [`outputs/`](outputs/).

---

## 7. Dataset Mapping

### Proposal dataset
IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset.

### Implementation mapping
Expected raw input:
- [`data/raw/Telco Customer Churn (IBM)/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`](data/raw/Telco%20Customer%20Churn%20%28IBM%29/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)

Expected cleaned output:
- [`data/processed/cleaned_churn.csv`](data/processed/cleaned_churn.csv)

---

## 8. Research Question Mapping

### RQ1
**Which factors are the strongest predictors of churn?**

Implementation support:
- [`src/eda.py`](src/eda.py)
- [`src/explain.py`](src/explain.py)
- feature importance outputs
- SHAP-based analysis

### RQ2
**Which model performs best?**

Implementation support:
- [`src/train.py`](src/train.py)
- [`src/evaluate.py`](src/evaluate.py)
- performance comparison tables
- confusion matrices
- ROC curve comparison

### RQ3
**How should retention be prioritized?**

Implementation support:
- [`src/prioritize.py`](src/prioritize.py)
- customer priority tables
- top retention target outputs

---

## 9. Paper Chapter Mapping

### Introduction
Driven by proposal problem statement and business motivation.

### Literature Review
Guided by the proposal topic and final study scope.

### Methodology
Mapped to the modules under [`src/`](src/).

### Results
Mapped to the outputs under [`outputs/`](outputs/).

### Discussion
Mapped to business interpretation, explainability findings, and retention strategy implications.

## 10. Final Principle

The proposal is not only an archived document. It is the governing source for:
- business scope,
- method selection,
- output expectations,
- paper structure,
- implementation boundaries.

Any future expansion, including a future frontend where [`Next.js`](docs/frontend_integration_plan.md) is the default choice and React remains a lightweight fallback, should still remain consistent with the proposal-defined business purpose.
